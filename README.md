# Strongbox SDK Web Widgets

The **Strongbox FinConnect Widget** makes it simple for your customer to connect their accounting system from your website using the Strongbox SDK.

This repo also contains a sample React application that demonstrates how to use the widget and the Strongbox SDK.  The sample application is running live here: [Widget Demo](https://widgetdemo.strongbox.link/). Once you have created credentials in the [Strongbox Developer Portal](https://developer.strongbox.link/) you will be able to use the running sample application to experience how the widget works.
