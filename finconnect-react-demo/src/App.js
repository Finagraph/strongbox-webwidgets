/*
 * IMPORTANT: This sample illustrates making calls to the Strongbox service to 
 * generate secure access tokens.  The following constants are defined below: clientId
 * and clientSecret. You will need to provide the values that have been assigned for your
 * organization.    DO NOT EXPOSE THOSE CREDENTIALS AS IS DONE IN THIS DEMONSTRATION APP.
 * THOSE CREDENTIALS SECURE YOUR ACCESS TO STRONGBOX AND ANYONE WHO POSSESSES THEM CAN
 * ACCESS STRONGBOX ON YOUR BEHALF.   THE CODE SHOWN BELOW FOR CREATING SECURITY TOKENS 
 * SHOULD BE EXECUTED ON A SERVER OWNED BY THE PARTNER WHERE SECURE ACCESS TO CREDENTIALS
 * CAN BE PROVIDED SUCH AS THROUGH MICROSOFT AZURE KEYVAULT OR SIMILAR SERVICES.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: A couple values need to be replaced in this file.  Search for 'TODO'.
 * 
 * This sample code demonstrates how to use the Strongbox FinConnect react component
 * that guides a user through the process of connecting Strongbox to their accounting
 * system such that it can gather their financial information from the accounting 
 * system and provide analysis of that data to a financial institution partnered with
 * Finagraph.
 * 
 * The process is straight-forward and divided in to two parts. The first step is to 
 * generate an access token.  This token is generated for an organization that has partnered
 * with Finagraph and has received a carefully guarded clientId and clientSecret that
 * identifies the partner to Strongbox.
 * 
 * In the code below 'componentDidMount' is devoted exclusively to this first step. Once you
 * add your partner credentials, it uses those to generate an access token and once generated 
 * stores it in state for the App component.  That code has a number of 'console.log' messages 
 * sprinkled throughout so you can follow the progress in the browser developer tools.
 * 
 * The second step is to simply include the React component in your code.  The render method 
 * is devoted to showing what a simple credit application with the Strongbox React component 
 * might look like.  When the user presses the button to connect their financial records they
 * are allowed to choose from the supported accounting packages and connect Strongbox
 * to their financial records.
 * 
 * The majority of the code in render is devoted to showing a sample application.  
 * The 'StrongboxFinConnect' component is imported from the component module and completely contained
 * within <StrongboxFinConnect... in render.
 * 
 * In this sample application the react component is not displayed until a delegated access
 * token has been created and is simply not present. An actual consumer is of course free to 
 * do this as well or show something that indicates it's loading, etc.
 * 
 * ----------------- Branding and Customization ------------------------
 * 
 * These are fully detailed in the ReadMe for the Strongbox React component but warrant a quick
 * mention here.  These are both optional.
 * 
 * You can override most of the colors and appearance of UI elements in the component.  This is
 * accomplished by passing the optional 'theme' property to the component.  It's an object that has
 * a number of members related to the appearance of the component, for example, colors (palette).  
 * An example would be:
 * 
 * theme={{
 *      palette: {
 *          windowBackground: '#d0d0d0',
 *          controlBackground: '#000000',
 *      }
 * }}     
 * 
 * As you might guess, this would result in the main window background being gray and the background
 * of user input controls like buttons being black.
 * 
 * The consumer of the component has some control over most of the colors, font parameters and some 
 * elements of appearance such as the radius of elements like buttons.
 * 
 * For experimenting with appearance, for example color, you can try this sample theme. You can just 
 * be able to cut and paste this as a prop following the strongboxUri prop on <StrongboxFinConnect... 
 * below and see what the effect is:
 * 
                    theme={{
                        palette: {
                            windowBackground: '#d0d0d0',
                            borrowerInteractionBackground: '#d0d0d0',
                            controlBackground: '#000000',
                            controlForeground: '#fff',
                            modalBackground: '#d0d0d0',
                            modalText: '#fff',
                            modalTitle: '#fff',
                            progressBarForeground: '#fff',
                        },
                        font: {
                            family: 'courier',
                            controlSize: '16px',
                            size: '16px',
                            size_h1: '24px',
                            modalFamily: 'courier',
                            modalTitleSize: '24px',
                        },
                        container: {
                            paddingLeft: '100px',
                        },
                        controls: {
                            borderRadius: '10px',
                        }
                    }}

 * All of the fields shown above are optional.  If no value is provided the default value will be
 * provided so fox example the following would be completely valid and only effect the font  family
 * 
 * theme = {{
 *      font: {
 *          family: 'mistral',
 *      }
 * }}
 * 
 * You also have control over some of the content that appears on the various steps in the component.
 * If you notice within the included component below, it has children. In this sample, that is specifically
 *
 * {(props) => {
 *      return undefined;
 * }}
 *
 * 'props' has a member called step that describes what step is being rendered.  If any value other than
 * undefined is returned, that content will replace the default content.
 *
 * For experimenting with content you can try the sample below.  In the sample code where 
 * it returns undefined under <StrongboxFinConnect, you can replace that code with the following snippet.
 * to observe the effect.
 * 
                    {(props) => {
